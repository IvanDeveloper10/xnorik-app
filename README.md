# XNORIK

<<<<<<< HEAD
Xnorik is a web application specifically designed to optimize and maintain fluid communication between the repair technician and the customer. Its main purpose is to offer a centralized channel where the customer can be informed at all times about the status of the work being performed, from the reception of the equipment or service request, to the final delivery. Through this platform, the technician can record progress, notify updates, share observations or recommendations, and even detail estimated costs and times, providing greater transparency and confidence in the process. For their part, the customer has a space where they can resolve doubts, follow up on each stage, and be assured that the service is being carried out in a professional and organized manner. In this way, Xnorik not only improves communication efficiency but also strengthens the relationship between the customer and the technician, generating a clearer, more reliable, and satisfactory experience.
